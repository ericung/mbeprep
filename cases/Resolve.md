**Resolve**

The C-130 transport plane roared against the ink-black sky, vibrating through Lieutenant Alex Carter’s core. His hands moved quickly, checking and rechecking his gear like clockwork, yet the straps felt foreign, loose—or maybe too tight. He forced himself to stop second-guessing, muttering under his breath, “Here we go,” though the words carried less confidence than he'd hoped.

The cold wind tore through the open bay as Carter leapt into the void. For a fleeting moment, everything stopped—the noise, the weight of the mission, even himself. Then the parachute blossomed above him, jolting his body into awareness as the descent began. The snow-covered expanse stretched endlessly below, indifferent to his presence, indifferent to everything. The thought clung to him like frostbite: *This isn’t resolve; this is endurance—barely.*

The ground came too fast. Carter steadied himself as the snow slammed into him, gathering his chute and trudging toward the distant cabin. Its outline shimmered unnaturally in the shadows, wavering like a mirage. *It’s solid,* Carter told himself. *Real. You need it to be.*

Halfway there, motion sliced through his periphery—a stray cat darting across his path. Its wiry gray fur blended almost perfectly with the snow, but its piercing yellow eyes betrayed it. Carter froze. The cat crouched low, studying him with unnerving intensity, as though it saw past his mission, his gear, his title. For a brief moment, it lingered, poised to attack—or flee. Then, in one sharp motion, it bolted into the shadows, vanishing without a trace.

Carter exhaled sharply. *Survivor,* he thought. *Not built for this, but it keeps going, knowing when to dart and when to wait.* His steps quickened. The cat’s movements lingered with him—not as an omen, but as a truth he hadn’t wanted to face.

The cabin grew closer, but it seemed smaller now, suffocated by the figures huddled in the icy gloom outside. Soldiers leaned against vehicles, their frames trembling as coughs rattled their bodies. Frost clung to their hair, their breath rising in faint clouds that vanished too quickly. One sat slouched on a wooden crate, his vacant eyes fixed on the horizon as though searching for something warmer, brighter. But there was nothing. Just the bitter air and the frozen ground that had consumed so many before them. *Ghosts,* Carter thought grimly. *They may still breathe, but the cold has already won.*

Beyond the cabin, yellow floodlights flickered weakly over the medical bay. Carter had passed it earlier, catching a glimpse of a young soldier sprawled on a cot inside. The boy—no older than twenty—lay pale and trembling, his sweat-slick skin shimmering against the backdrop of snow. His chest rose and fell in shallow, uneven motions, his hollow eyes darting beneath half-closed lids as though still fighting battles only he could see. Carter’s stomach twisted. *He doesn’t belong here. None of us do.* But he didn’t stop. He couldn’t. The mission demanded momentum, even when the world begged him to pause.

Inside the cabin, the air grew thicker, heavier. Carter’s boots pressed into the creaking floorboards as he took in the scene. A battered wooden table divided two men whose scars—both visible and hidden—marked them as survivors of battles far beyond this one.

On one side sat Major Sergei Orlov, his pale blue eyes sharp, calculating. His fingers drummed against the table in restless rhythm, though it was clear the silence weighed on him more than he wanted to admit. His jaw clenched tightly as Carter entered, the muscles flickering like fault lines ready to crack. *Another American with empty words,* Orlov thought bitterly. *Does he even understand what this war has taken? What it will keep taking?* His hand brushed his holster instinctively, though his fingers didn’t linger. *What’s left for me to protect anyway?*

Across from him, Colonel Ivan Marchenko leaned back slightly, though his posture carried more exhaustion than ease. His storm-gray eyes flicked briefly to Carter, then back to Orlov, gauging the tension but unwilling to let it settle. *How many times have I sat at tables like this?* Marchenko thought. *How many promises have I buried alongside the men who believed in them?* His scarred hands rested on the table’s edge, steady but unmoving. He studied Orlov—his sharp movements, his biting gaze—but said nothing. There were no answers to be found here, only moments stolen before the next storm.

Carter stood between them, feeling the weight of their histories, their distrust, their grudging hopes. “Gentlemen,” he said, his voice even despite the tension. *They don’t want peace, but they’ll take what they can get. Just keep them talking—keep them thinking long enough to sign.*

Orlov sneered, leaning forward as though his words might slice the table in two. “You think your words mean anything here, Lieutenant? This land bleeds, and treaties are just paper soaked in blood.” His tone was venomous, yet the bitterness carried something else—a frayed edge, a quiet fear. *This charade won’t save them. It won’t save us.*

Carter didn’t flinch. “I don’t care about your poetic nonsense,” he shot back, his Midwestern cadence grounding him. “You want your men alive tomorrow? Then you sign the damn treaty tonight.”

Marchenko shifted in his chair, his fingers curling faintly as the weight of doubt pressed against him. “And what guarantees do we have,” he asked, his voice deep and steady, “that they won’t break it the moment the ink dries?” He wasn’t asking for reassurance; he was asking for time.

“None,” Carter replied bluntly, the word final, unyielding. “But if you don’t try, you’ll be counting bodies instead of victories. Your call.”

The silence stretched long enough to become almost unbearable. Then, Orlov exhaled sharply, pulling a pen from his pocket. His movements were stiff, deliberate, his signature slow as though carving it into the paper. *Let them believe in smoke,* he thought. *The fire is always waiting.*

Marchenko took the pen next, his hand hovering over the paper. He hesitated—not in doubt, but in exhaustion. Then, with quiet resolve, he signed, the ink dragging slightly against the cold surface. *Just long enough,* he thought. *Long enough to bury the ones already gone.*

Carter folded the treaty and tucked it into his jacket. His breath felt steady now, his hands sure. *Resolve,* he thought. Not clarity. Not certainty. But it would have to be enough.

Outside, the biting wind met him like an old adversary, yet it no longer stung. The cat’s tracks had vanished under fresh snowfall, its fleeting presence both forgotten and remembered. In the distance, the faint yellow glow of the medical bay flickered, a reminder that this mission wasn’t about peace; it was about enduring the moments stolen before war returned.

**"In a land where treaties dissolve like snowflakes on a rifle barrel, Alex Carter knew this was just another storm—one he’d weather until the next one came roaring in."**
