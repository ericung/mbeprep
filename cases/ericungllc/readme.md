     3. Conduct periodic penetration testing to identify and patch vulnerabilities.
     4. Train users on safe networking practices, such as recognizing phishing attempts or securing access credentials.
   - **Outcome**: An individual network that is resilient to external threats and ensures secure communication.

---

### **3. Task: Securing the Identity of an Individual in a Network**
   - **Objective**: Protect individual identities from exposure or theft within the communication network.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Implement anonymization techniques, such as dynamic IP masking or routing through secure virtual private networks (VPNs).
     2. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to strengthen access security.
     3. Introduce user-specific encryption keys to ensure that only authorized parties can decrypt communications.
     4. Monitor metadata (e.g., time stamps, location data) to avoid accidental disclosure of identifying information.
   - **Outcome**: Comprehensive identity protection for individuals communicating within the network.

---

### **4. Task: Ethical Cyber Training for Communications Specialists**
   - **Objective**: Equip specialists with the knowledge to protect networks and individuals while adhering to ethical and legal standards.
