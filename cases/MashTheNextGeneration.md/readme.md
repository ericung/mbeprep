# Mash - The Next Generation 

## One - Garand

 _Hope this stays like Mash – The next generation_

Wednesday afternoon at the edge of spring and I am drinking a cup of coffee in the office listening to SFC Guillette babbling with Corporal Pearson like always. Obviously, we know who wants the promotion. Then enters the beef cake known to the outside world as Sergeant Santiago known to lift the hearts and minds of the public with his impressive physique and his bright, uplifting smile. It’s the complete opposite in the office as he hides in the corner of the tiny little building like an elephant. There’s obviously Private Wilhelm studying for his test on the fundamentals of law like a cultist but no one actually knows why he works so damn hard. He says one thing and does the other. Every other person in his rank and above is intrigued and scared of him. Private Bailey tricks a hat in front of the other privates, obviously she’s going to rise above the ranks with flying colors through the eyes of experience I’ve acquired along the way. 

“Hey Shotley, let’s get some grub”, said Second Lieutenant Lu.

“Let’s go”, Shotley interrupted.

I added a sign of hand and quick copy reply and so did the rest of our pack.
The camp is bustling with activity and live music like a college freshman experience, but I never went. Instead, I enlisted right away and did some moot combat missions to get a few promotions like everyone else. I don’t really know why, it’s just what everyone wants to do except I kind of had some reason as to why but didn’t realize it at the time. In comes an uncovered retro hummer ready to break down at any moment with none other than Sergeant Rice and Sergeant Lehner. The prettiest marines you’ll ever see. I grumbled quietly as they go about their routine of ransacking the camp supplies of whatever marines need and do. 

“Holy fucking shit! It’s Ron from 103rd company!”, said Rice. 

“Oh my god! Say it isn’t so!”, said Lehner.

“You guys are a bunch of fucking assholes! Seriously! I worked my ass off for that particular piece of M&Ms! Don’t take that one!”, said Ron, “FOR REAL?!? The whole thing? Wow!!! More now!”.

They’re off kicking each other and fighting and the two marines run outside of camp. Honestly, I don’t really know why they are here. Logistically, they are supposed to be on a different side of the world but the Navy carrier is here so might as well explore the world. 

“Hey T, what are you doing after 1700?”, said Dane.

“I am going to the laundromat”, I said.

“We’re going to play volleyball. Let’s go!”, Saw said.

“Let’s go!”, I replied. 

We’re eager to finish up grub with Lu and Shotley and the rest of the usual company. Major Johnson walks in and pulls Lu out of the group urgently. This is unusual as he’s in a different class. We go about chatting and munching on chow like usual, it’s just another day to us with this occasional exception. Lu comes in and interjects like he’s seen a ghost this time even more so than usual. That’s practically every time because everything we’ve done was live simulations of combat and if actually real, very controlled and contained.  No serious injuries because the chain of command wants us spotless. Bailey and her cohort finish up their drill and as the Major enters the M1, an unusual gun fire from 2000 yards away is heard. It’s weird because the range is in the opposite direction south of camp.

“What the fuck is that?”, said Dane.

“Holy shit!”, with Saw in order.

There’s an explosion coming from the origin of the gun fire. This is unusual not because it’s really close to camp and not because the Major is close by. It’s unusual because everyone stopped to look at the general direction of the event. No one has ever done this before, not even the privates. There’s a slight moment of silence as everyone is waiting for Lu’s command. Then after a few moments, a moped drives in with Roberts from the other company in it rushing to us, specifically Lu. The Major long gone by now south of us.

“Herd and Fleming have the situation contained, Lieutenant Sergeant Lu!”, said Roberts. 

“Shotley! Take you and a few of the privates to scout ahead!”, Lu said.

“Sir! Yes! Sir!”, Shotley said.

“Wilhelm! You’re with me!”, Shotley said.

Obviously, we’re in a group because why would Lu send someone close to him personally on a dangerous mission? There might be some suspicion of foul play in the ranks. Corporal Nick comes in with Shotley’s rank. Obviously, his right-hand man for almost every mission. As they start marching towards the explosion, there’s a disgruntled enlistee mumbling, “Tits my ass!” with another enlistee. 

“Trent! Cover them!”, said Lu.

“Sir! Yes! Sir!”, I replied.

As we march towards the explosion about 2000 yards away, I wondered why Lu didn’t change his alias – or maybe he didn’t have a choice. It reveals too much about opposition hidden and in public. It is a common surname in the area we’re in but not in the region. What if this traces back to our home country? Who cares. As I cover Shotley’s crew of enlistees, there’s a peculiar barrel of oil sitting right in the middle of the objective with a peculiar symbol looking almost like a circle with a few crosses between them. No one seems to be paying attention except for maybe Wilhelm. As we march closer to the objective, there’s even more debris or some weird burnt rubbish the closer we get to the objective. This isn’t the work of the Seal team on the Navy carrier and it isn’t the marines because they’re a bunch of jarheads. The suspense draws near and it turns out to be an artillery shell close to camp! But there was a sound of gun fire.

“Holy shit!”, said Private Burns, “Who shot the gun?”.

“Wow!”, Private Wilhelm said as he started investigating naturally like always.

“Shotley! We’re over here!”, said Fleming with Herd on his side.

With a quick glint of the other company investigating, I check the rest of our team’s health. Everything seems to be fine. 

“Wilhelm! Nick! Take attendance of Fleming’s entire company and see who’s missing!”, said Shotley.

I figured that Shotley’s conclusion is that if Fleming’s company is already here, they must already know what is happening.

“Look at this, Lieutenant Shotley!”, said Private Pu from out of nowhere. 

With a significant of disappointment, Shotley says, “Wow! This is going to be a huge problem for the major. Trent, take it with you to Lu”.
I grabbed what looked like the remains of a Garand and put them in my sack. I’m wondering why this kind of rifle is even here in the first place. The marines are fitted with the optimal rifles currently in terms of cost and combat effectiveness. This old piece of history isn’t useful and as I wondered about this, I hear the Lieutenant yell, “Fleming!!! Attendance check!!! Wilhelm, get an attendance check with the marines!”. It’s about 2100 now and what seemed like a normal day at the beach again after 1700, turned out to be an interesting one.

 
## Two – Camp

One of the things that’s weird about this particular camp is that there’s female soldiers here but no one hits on them even though they are far more attractive than the most girls at home and the most interesting feature is that they are really dense and lively in a manner I can’t explain. Every single one of them has some sort of quality that lets them rise up quickly in the ranks. Even the girls in the villages as close to us 50 miles away can’t really compete with them. There’s no reports of sexual assault at least to the public. Personally, everyone is very friendly. No one talks about banging each other, no one talks about scoring or anything. Even though we all talk shit and have potty mouths and might jerk off once or twice in private to the females here, no one cares. It’s very clean. As I sit in my office pondering this oddity, Pearson comes up and annoys me.

“What is it Pearson?!?”, I said aggravated.

“Geez T! You don’t have to be so mean!”, Pearson replied.

“Look at all this paperwork! Why can’t we write a program or something to handle this?”, I said.

“Its just busy work. No one cares. Seriously?”, Pearson said with a snap.

“Really? Who’s going to take care of the food and fuel authorizations?”, I snorted out.

Pearson grabs me in a seriously friendly manner by the neck and does a light talking, “Get out of the office and hang out with me!”.

“Fuck you Pearson! Fine!!!”, I replied.

“Geez Luis! You’re leaving this place in a few days and you don’t want to hang out with your best friend?”, she said almost going to cry but kind of faking like always.

It’s past 1700 and everyone’s going to the beach and hanging out and whatever. I’ve already made peace with the others. Pearson and I talk about what we’re going to do after we get back home in the usually quiet public part of camp.

“Can we see each other again? This is my contact.”, she said shoving a piece of paper onto my face.

“You know we can’t really see each other right away when we get back home right? You should know this! You’re ranks above me!”, I said.

“That’s no fair!”, she said with a reply.

“Lu assigned me with a new MOS”, I said, “I don’t know when I’ll be done or where I’ll end up”.

I took the contact information and as I did it, something inside me started to kick in. It’s kind of like anger or something I can’t describe as I blurted out some word out in our conversation or something. I don’t know. As I slowly get back together, I want to hug Pearson, but I can’t. I can sense the same thing from her too, however. As I do, I cool down and I am able to and so we did.

The next few days, I get placed in a detention center for a week so that I can reflect on the new MOS and debrief on my time at this camp. I kind of miss everything and everyone, but not really. I don’t really feel comfortable caring; I don’t feel dead inside or anything. Nervous, angry, and hurt a little maybe. Even though I’ll be entering a combat zone and carrying lethal weapons again, something inside me turned and I remember carnage and rage but I hold it in really well. The objective is simple, just get the M1 and the belongings to the opposition’s commander and public defendant. Marines will be escorting the M1 we’re riding in. This is about 300 miles away from camp in the opposition’s main city center. It seems pretty far but not with modern equipment and vehicles. It only sucks if everything breaks down. It’s dangerous crossing the border because of mines and the occasional unobservant grunt with a radio into the heart of artillery and snipers that will make you explode by default. Nothing too nerve wracking or anything. I’ll be going with Gillete, Shotley, and Wilheim. This is the normal team with the exception of Wilheim who’s only a few missions in because of his potential – he’s definitely underpaid for this kind of work and with his skills too. Geez, he should be at Harvard trying for world peace or something, but he’s stuck here doing god’s work. One wrong miscommunication and even the slightest mishap and the whole squadron gets wiped out – marines too. We’ve been working on this line for decades and if our team succeeds, the next successor, which will be Pearson, can take over. I can go back home peacefully with the next line successfully in place. 

Leaving the detention center and entering the mission smoothly, time marches slowly from 0430 to whenever it takes to get to the main city center, I look back at Dane and Saw and the others and see that we made the best of our time together. It’ll be nice starting a business and everything with them but I don’t know if they’ll be back in one piece. I just let my mind wander and I remember the piece of paper with Pearson’s contact I have on my chest pocket. Way too young but they can handle it. I’m old by military standards for the type of work I do. Lu said I have more skills to fit back into society than I realize. I have to believe him this time around. Time marches slowly, I’ve lost track of time but with my rifle in hand ready at any time. Wilheim chained up to the case like a prisoner. Gillete shotgun to Shotley who’s the driver with a backpack full of equipment and drugs that can put an elephant out. As I look outside the M1, there’s three shitty hummers ready to break down in a minute’s notice with three pairs of marines, Rice and Lehner included, with their cost and combat effective rifles. The usual pack of the prettiest marines you’ll ever see. Every time I see them hit a rock in the road, I laugh a little. 300 miles of this?

As we’re about halfway somewhere in the most dangerous part of the path, I see a small group of radiomen out in the open from the opposition. They flashed a light and we’re good to go. I’m getting sleepy and want to take a nap but I get a pack of caffeine and mix it with the mobile canteen to wake up a bit. That’s a good sign. This is my last mission. And I repeat this over and over. I’m so tired… I got to keep vigilance. I repeat this over and over. 

Eons fly and around 0300 the next day, we finally reach the main city center. Almost 12 hours from camp. Only the street rats are awake peddling the usual, marines are still there with Rice and Lehner dead tired. In front of us, is the government center and open space to park the M1 and three shitty hummers. We get out of the vehicles in unison like clockwork. Wilheim is struggling a little bit but he can handle it. He doesn’t really complain or anything. I pick the rifle up and work my way to the hotel room that the diplomats go to for negotiation and disputes. I fell asleep. That’s all I know.
 
## Three – Negotiations

A week flies by and we’re all settled in and ready to negotiate. Everyone’s calm. No weapons in the meeting room except for the grunts. Some grunts in the opposition’s rank escort us there. No emotions or anything. Like clockwork. Wilheim prepares the case full of negotiations and treaties mostly on physical resources like energy and metals but who cares. The table we’re using looks special, like it’s from some rainforest or something. Who knows. A line of unarmed soldiers in special decorations walks into the meeting room already filled with armed soldiers but you can sense a kind of aura with them even though they are smaller than the rest. In comes the commander along with the public defendant. They are familiar faces in most regards, I forgot their names. Something Asiatic in the region. Even though they have a straight face and everything, Shotley presents everything to the public defendant. For some odd reason, they looked at me after opening up an envelope and reading it a little. They obviously know English because there’s no translator available. In their language, they talk to each other.

“Give us another week and we’ll hear back from the council.”, said the public defendant.

Another week flies by and I’m eating the local food from the convenient store in my room. Someone knocks on my door. It’s Wilheim.

“Sir! Shotley wants you to go to room 3A”, said Wilheim.

I take a deep breath and get escorted by the grunts. Wilheim stands in attention as I walk away. I sense dread and despair and some slight of optimism. I am a little shaky as I get to the room and as I enter it, Shotley is standing there ready to meet me. As the door closes behind me with the public defendant on the side and a few armed grunts, Shotley says, “Trent, you have a choice. We either lock you up here in safety for a little while or you continue to the next MOS.”

“I knew it.”, I replied.

“You can leave any time.”, the public defendant interrupted with, “You excel at everything you do but you have some issues. Your objective is obviously to mow all the soldiers you see around you by any means necessary. With the type of training you went through and the addition of your actual life as a civilian, I’m speechless at what you did instead. You stopped our country from going to war with yours. You’re a hero to us. Seriously, why would you go back? You know they are going to sterilize you and put you to sleep if you’re lucky?”

“I need some time to think about it,” I rolled my eyes over at one of the familiar looking grunts.

“We’ll check up on you in two weeks.” she said with a snide expression, “The commander is so tired of seeing people like you come into our country like this. You’ll love living here. Seriously.”

I stay in my room most of the time occasionally taking trips to the convenience store. I make small talk with some of the other marines in the hotel. On the days that I don’t talk to the locals and the store owner, I usually ponder what life would be like once I transition out of service and go into civilian life. Pearson’s contact is obviously in my chest pocket and in my mind as I relax in the public space of the hotel with the remaining marines on standby doing what marines are known to do.  Wilheim occasionally drops down the flight of stairs directly targeting the water dispenser every so often panting. After taking a one- or two-hour break, he runs back up the flight of stairs. Wilheim can handle it. He’s young. About two weeks later, I see Wilheim come down the stairs, sigh, and look at me finally.

“Sir! The commander wants to see you!”, Wilheim said.

“Thank you Wilheim”, I replied.

I walk up the flight of stairs not in a rush and not as slowly possible. For some reason, I’m dog tired. As I make my way towards the negotiation room, I see Gillette and Rice in a heated debate. As I entered the door, the commander and the public defendant stopped looking at Shotley who now has a black eye on his right and paler expression on his face and turned their heads towards me. 

“Trent, we’ve decided that you’re going into the civilian sector for a decade.”, the public defendant said.

“Yes, ma’am”, I replied. 

“Thank you!”, the commander said with the best of English he can pronounce.

“We’ll prepare proper departure a week from now,” the public defendant said.

With a smirk of piggish behavior, I left the room. I don’t know whether I should be happier or disappointed with the results. This is one of the quickest negotiations our team has faced overall and this is the last one our team we’ll see in a while with my team. Gillette, Rice, and Lehner are at my attention as we all leave the room. A week flies by, the M1 and the three shitty hummers are packed and ready to roll out with some of the more familiar grunts in formation. It’s 0400 at the hotel of diplomats of negotiations and disputes. Eyes wide open and vigilant of any threats. You can’t really say it’s wrong doings especially when you enlisted at a young age and you can’t really say much when most of it is unintentional. I have a headache every time I look at the deep scar from the palm of my hand. The M1 breaks down far out of any checkpoint midway between the hotel and the departure camp. 

“Psycho! Warheads! Investigate and repair the engine!”, Rice said.

“Sir! Yes! Sir!”, Psycho and Warheads replied back.

Shotley doesn’t say or tell anything to us as we cover Psycho and Warheads. Psycho identifies the pain points and Warheads takes the wrench from Gillete’s hand directly. I look around and see some light cover 500 yards out but other than that we’re dead out in the open. No grunt in sight or that I can make out with the naked eye, but for some reason, I know there’s at least a couple pair of eyes on us. One can develop a sense of schizophrenia from this phenomenon. I’m muttering to myself, “Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!”, repeatedly. Wilheim, who barely holds a rifle, is sweating bullets as literal as the standard of the phrase is intended to be. As it looks like they’re midway repairing the M1, I can feel the once, carefully placed stitches on the thigh of my right leg open up, but they’re healed up, but they’re opening up inside. No, they’re not. I can start feeling my heart flutter a little bit. I take an eye at Shotley for like the hundredth time, he’s not doing anything like wandering off or anything again, especially with his current experience at the hotel. I remember Pearson’s contact on my chest pocket.

After an hour or two, we get back rolling. The majority of the birthmarks on my body heal up again and we continue to roll into nightfall and get to camp. This is actually one of the shortest trips in our team’s books logistics-wise using the M1. Its 1300 the next day as we hit the departure camp and we head straight to the detention center to do a health check for a week. This particular camp is different but it’s past the same direction as the camp Lu is in. It’s mostly to get to the planes that get us back home. None of us talk to each other. As I get ready to leave detention, I see Wilheim is still holding back tears. But he can handle, he always can. He’s young. 

We wait for our plane and enter the camp of separations. A blink of time flashes and we’re off at the camp of separations and depart ways dog tired, not muttering anything to each other. Wilheim is crying as he enters his armored carrier to go back home safely as possible as he intended. This ends my team’s operation line which is one of the longest running operations for a single team to handle without communicating or going back home for however long it was since I was 18. Now its successors take place. I remember I still have Pearson’s contact on my chest pocket.
