# Identify the conclusion lsat skills

The "Identify the Conclusion" question type on the LSAT tests your ability to understand the main point the author is trying to convey.  It's crucial to distinguish between supporting evidence, background information, and the actual conclusion. Here's a breakdown of the skills involved and how to approach these questions:

**Key Skills Tested:**

* **Understanding Argument Structure:** You must be able to recognize the difference between premises (evidence), intermediate conclusions (sub-conclusions), and the main conclusion.
* **Distinguishing Conclusion from Premises:**  The conclusion is what the author is *trying to prove*.  The premises are the *reasons* given to support the conclusion.
* **Identifying the Main Point:** The main conclusion is the overall point the author wants the reader to accept. It's often, but not always, stated explicitly.
* **Recognizing Unstated Conclusions:** Sometimes the conclusion is implied rather than directly stated.  You'll need to infer it based on the premises and the overall flow of the argument.
* **Ignoring Irrelevant Information:**  LSAT passages often include extra details or background information that are not essential to the argument.  You must be able to filter out this irrelevant information to focus on the core argument.
* **Understanding the Author's Scope:** Pay close attention to the limitations the author places on their conclusion.  A conclusion might be qualified with words like "probably," "likely," or "in most cases."

**How to Approach "Identify the Conclusion" Questions:**

1. **Read the Entire Passage Carefully:** Don't jump to conclusions (pun intended!).  Understand the author's overall message before trying to identify the conclusion.
2. **Look for Conclusion Indicators:** Certain words and phrases often signal a conclusion:
    * "Therefore"
    * "Thus"
    * "Hence"
    * "Consequently"
    * "As a result"
    * "It follows that"
    * "Clearly"
    * "Obviously"
    * "In conclusion"
    * "Therefore, we can see that..."
3. **Identify the Premises:** What reasons does the author give to support their point?  Understanding the premises will help you identify what the author is trying to prove.
4. **Paraphrase the Main Point:**  Put the author's conclusion into your own words.  This can help you clarify the main point and avoid getting tricked by answer choices that are close but not quite right.
5. **Consider the Author's Scope:** Is the conclusion broad or narrow?  Is it qualified or absolute?  Pay attention to any limitations the author places on their conclusion.
6. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:** Choose the answer choice that best expresses the author's main conclusion.  Be wary of:
    * **Premises:** Answer choices that restate a premise are incorrect.
    * **Intermediate Conclusions:**  These are sub-conclusions that support the main conclusion, but they are not the main conclusion itself.
    * **Too Broad or Too Narrow:** The correct answer choice will match the scope of the author's conclusion.
    * **Distorted or Exaggerated Conclusions:**  The correct answer choice will accurately reflect the author's point, without adding anything new or distorting the original meaning.
    * **Irrelevant Information:**  Answer choices that bring in information not discussed in the passage are incorrect.

**Example:**

Passage: "Studies have shown a correlation between regular exercise and improved cognitive function.  Furthermore, exercise has been linked to reduced stress levels and a lower risk of heart disease.  Therefore, it is clear that everyone should engage in regular physical activity."

Conclusion: "Everyone should engage in regular physical activity."

**Common Traps:**

* **Confusing a premise with the conclusion.**
* **Selecting an intermediate conclusion instead of the main conclusion.**
* **Choosing an answer that is too broad or too narrow.**
* **Falling for answers that introduce new information or distort the author's point.**

Practice is key! The more you work on "Identify the Conclusion" questions, the better you'll become at recognizing the subtle cues and avoiding the common traps.


# Introduction to arguments

Let's dive into an introduction to arguments!  Arguments are a fundamental part of communication, reasoning, and persuasion.  They're not just disagreements or shouting matches; they're structured attempts to justify a claim or belief.

**What is an Argument?**

An argument, in the logical sense, is a set of statements designed to support a conclusion.  It consists of:

* **Premises (or Reasons):** These are the statements offered as evidence or justification for the conclusion.  They are the "why" behind your belief.
* **Conclusion:** This is the statement the arguer is trying to prove or persuade the audience to accept.  It's what the arguer is arguing *for*.

**Example:**

* **Premise 1:** All men are mortal.
* **Premise 2:** Socrates is a man.
* **Conclusion:** Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

**Key Features of Arguments:**

* **Purpose:** The purpose of an argument is to persuade, convince, or demonstrate something to an audience.
* **Structure:** Arguments have a specific structure, with premises leading to a conclusion.
* **Reasoning:** Arguments rely on reasoning to connect the premises to the conclusion.  This reasoning can be deductive, inductive, or abductive (more on these later).
* **Validity (in formal logic):**  A valid argument is one where, *if* the premises are true, the conclusion *must* also be true.  Validity is about the *form* of the argument, not necessarily the truth of the premises.
* **Soundness:** A sound argument is one that is both valid *and* has true premises.  Only sound arguments can guarantee a true conclusion.
* **Persuasiveness:**  A persuasive argument is one that is effective in convincing the intended audience.  Persuasiveness depends not only on logic but also on rhetoric, emotion, and other factors.

**Types of Arguments:**

* **Deductive Arguments:** These arguments start with general principles and apply them to specific cases.  If the premises are true and the form is valid, the conclusion *must* be true.  (Example: The Socrates argument above).
* **Inductive Arguments:** These arguments start with specific observations and draw a general conclusion.  Even if the premises are true, the conclusion is only *probably* true. (Example: "Every swan I have ever seen is white. Therefore, all swans are white."  This was considered true for a long time until black swans were discovered.)
* **Abductive Arguments:** These arguments try to find the best explanation for a set of observations.  They are often used in scientific reasoning and detective work. (Example: "The grass is wet.  It must have rained last night.")

**Distinguishing Arguments from Non-Arguments:**

It's important to be able to distinguish arguments from other types of communication:

* **Statements of Fact:**  "The Earth is round" is a statement of fact, not an argument.  It can be proven, but it's not trying to persuade you of anything.
* **Opinions:** "Chocolate ice cream is the best" is an opinion, not an argument.  It's a personal preference, not supported by reasons.
* **Explanations:** Explanations tell you *why* something happened.  Arguments try to prove *that* something is the case.
* **Descriptions:** Descriptions simply describe something.  They don't try to prove a point.

**Why are Arguments Important?**

Arguments are essential for:

* **Critical Thinking:** Evaluating arguments helps us to think critically and make informed decisions.
* **Communication:**  Arguments are a way to express our beliefs and persuade others.
* **Problem Solving:**  Arguments can help us to analyze problems and find solutions.
* **Knowledge Development:**  Scientific and philosophical progress relies on the construction and evaluation of arguments.

**In summary:** Arguments are structured sets of statements designed to support a conclusion.  Understanding the structure and types of arguments is essential for effective communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving.

# Types of conclusions

Conclusions come in various forms, each with its own nuances and implications.  Understanding these different types is crucial for critical thinking, argumentation, and analysis. Here's a breakdown of common conclusion types:

**1. Factual Conclusions:**

* **Description:** These conclusions assert that something is true or false based on evidence. They aim to establish facts.
* **Example:** "The Earth is round." (Supported by scientific evidence).
* **Characteristics:** Can be verified or falsified with evidence. Often based on observation or empirical data.

**2. Inferential Conclusions:**

* **Description:** These conclusions draw a logical inference from the available information. They go beyond what is explicitly stated.
* **Example:** "Since the witness saw the defendant fleeing the scene, it's likely they were involved in the crime." (Inference based on circumstantial evidence).
* **Characteristics:** Based on reasoning and interpretation of evidence.  Not always certain; can be probable or likely.

**3. Evaluative Conclusions:**

* **Description:** These conclusions make a judgment about the value, worth, or quality of something. They involve subjective criteria.
* **Example:** "This movie is excellent." (Based on personal taste and criteria for what constitutes a good movie).
* **Characteristics:** Involve subjective judgments and criteria.  Can vary depending on individual values and perspectives.

**4. Causal Conclusions:**

* **Description:** These conclusions assert a cause-and-effect relationship between two or more things.
* **Example:** "Increased advertising spending led to a rise in sales." (Asserting a causal link between advertising and sales).
* **Characteristics:** Require strong evidence to support the causal link.  Correlation does not equal causation.

**5. Predictive Conclusions:**

* **Description:** These conclusions make a prediction about what will happen in the future.
* **Example:** "The stock market will likely decline next year." (Based on current economic trends and analysis).
* **Characteristics:** Based on current trends and assumptions.  Inherently uncertain; future events are not guaranteed.

**6. Recommendations/Prescriptive Conclusions:**

* **Description:** These conclusions recommend a course of action or prescribe what should be done.
* **Example:** "The company should invest in renewable energy." (Recommending a specific action).
* **Characteristics:** Often based on values, goals, and available resources.  Involve a judgment about what is best or most desirable.

**7. Explanatory Conclusions:**

* **Description:** These conclusions offer an explanation for why something happened or is the case.
* **Example:** "The high unemployment rate is due to the recent economic recession." (Explaining unemployment based on economic factors).
* **Characteristics:** Seek to provide understanding and insight into causes or reasons.

**8. Conditional Conclusions:**

* **Description:** These conclusions state that something will be the case *if* a certain condition is met.
* **Example:** "If interest rates rise, housing prices will likely fall." (Conditional statement about the relationship between interest rates and housing prices).
* **Characteristics:** Dependent on the fulfillment of the stated condition.

**9. Universal/General Conclusions:**

* **Description:** These conclusions apply to all members of a group or category.
* **Example:** "All humans are mortal." (Applies to every single human being).
* **Characteristics:** Strong claims that require substantial evidence to support.  Often difficult to prove definitively.

**10. Particular/Specific Conclusions:**

* **Description:** These conclusions apply to specific individuals, cases, or situations.
* **Example:** "John Smith is likely guilty of the crime." (Applies to a specific individual in a specific situation).
* **Characteristics:** More limited in scope than universal conclusions.  May be easier to support with evidence.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Overlapping Categories:** Some conclusions might fall into multiple categories. For instance, a predictive conclusion might also be a conditional conclusion.
* **Strength of Evidence:** The type of conclusion influences the kind and strength of evidence needed to support it.
* **Context:** The context of the argument or discussion will determine the appropriateness of a particular type of conclusion.

Understanding these different types of conclusions will make you a more discerning reader, listener, and thinker. You'll be better equipped to evaluate arguments, identify weaknesses in reasoning, and construct your own persuasive arguments.


# Types of evidence

Evidence is the foundation of any legal case. It's how you prove or disprove the facts necessary to win. Here's a breakdown of the main types of evidence you'll encounter in legal proceedings:

**1. Direct Evidence:**

* **Description:** Directly proves a fact without the need for inference or assumption. It speaks for itself.
* **Examples:**
    * Eyewitness testimony ("I saw the defendant commit the crime.")
    * A signed contract
    * A video recording of the incident
* **Strengths:** Highly persuasive when credible.
* **Weaknesses:** Can be subject to bias, memory issues, or manipulation.

**2. Circumstantial Evidence:**

* **Description:** Requires an inference or assumption to connect it to a fact. It suggests a fact but doesn't directly prove it.
* **Examples:**
    * Fingerprints at the crime scene
    * The defendant fleeing the scene
    * Financial records showing a suspicious transaction
* **Strengths:** Can be powerful when multiple pieces of circumstantial evidence corroborate each other.
* **Weaknesses:** Can be open to interpretation and may lead to incorrect conclusions if not carefully analyzed.

**3. Physical Evidence (Real Evidence):**

* **Description:** Tangible objects or materials relevant to the case.
* **Examples:**
    * Weapons
    * DNA samples
    * Documents
    * Photographs
    * Clothing
* **Strengths:** Can be highly persuasive, especially when scientifically analyzed.
* **Weaknesses:** Can be tampered with or misinterpreted.

**4. Documentary Evidence:**

* **Description:** Written or recorded materials that provide information about the case.
* **Examples:**
    * Contracts
    * Emails
    * Letters
    * Medical records
    * Business records

* **Examples:**
    * Eyewitness testimony
    * Expert witness testimony
    * Character witness testimony
* **Strengths:** Can provide firsthand accounts of events or expert opinions.
* **Weaknesses:** Can be subject to bias, memory issues, or perjury.

**6. Demonstrative Evidence:**

* **Description:** Visual aids or exhibits used to illustrate or explain evidence.
* **Examples:**
    * Charts
    * Diagrams
    * Maps
    * Reenactments
* **Strengths:** Can make complex information easier to understand.
* **Weaknesses:** Must be accurate and not misleading.

**7. Expert Evidence:**

* **Description:** Testimony or opinions offered by qualified experts in a specific field.
* **Examples:**
    * Forensic scientists
    * Medical examiners
    * Appraisers
* **Strengths:** Can help the court understand complex issues.
* **Weaknesses:** Experts can be biased or their opinions may be challenged.

**8. Hearsay Evidence:**

* **Description:** Testimony about a statement made by someone else outside of court, offered to prove the truth of the statement.
* **Examples:**
    * "John told me that he saw the defendant commit the crime." (Unless John testifies himself, this is hearsay).
* **Strengths:** Generally not admissible in court due to its unreliability.
* **Weaknesses:** Can be admissible under certain exceptions.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Admissibility:** Evidence must be admissible in court to be considered. This means it must be relevant, probative, and not excluded by any rules of evidence.
* **Credibility:** The weight given to evidence depends on its credibility. Factors that affect credibility include the source of the evidence, its reliability, and any potential biases.
* **Burden of Proof:** The party with the burden of proof must present enough evidence to persuade the judge or jury to rule in their favor.

Understanding the different types of evidence and their strengths and weaknesses is essential for anyone involved in legal proceedings. Whether you're a lawyer, a party to a case, or simply interested in how the legal system works, knowing the various forms of evidence will help you better understand the process of establishing facts and reaching a just outcome.

# Types of flaws

You're right to focus on flaws! They're the weak points in arguments that make them unpersuasive or invalid. Here's a catalog of common flaws you'll encounter in arguments, especially on tests like the LSAT, GRE, and GMAT:

**I. Formal Fallacies (Errors in the Structure of the Argument):**

* **Affirming the Consequent:**
    * **Description:** Assuming that if the consequent (the result) is true, then the antecedent (the cause) must also be true.
    * **Example:** "If it rains, the ground will be wet. The ground is wet, therefore it must have rained." (The ground could be wet for other reasons).
* **Denying the Antecedent:**
    * **Description:** Assuming that if the antecedent (the cause) is false, then the consequent (the result) must also be false.
    * **Example:** "If it snows, school will be canceled. It didn't snow, therefore school will not be canceled." (School could be canceled for other reasons).
* **Undistributed Middle Term:**
    * **Description:** In a syllogism, the middle term (the term that connects the two premises) must be distributed (refer to all members of a category) at least once.
    * **Example:** "All dogs are mammals. All cats are mammals. Therefore, all dogs are cats." (Both premises are true, but the conclusion is false).

**II. Informal Fallacies (Errors in the Content or Reasoning of the Argument):**

* **Fallacies of Relevance:**
    * **Ad Hominem:** Attacking the person making the argument instead of the argument itself.
        * **Example:** "You're just saying that because you're biased."
    * **Straw Man:** Misrepresenting the opponent's argument to make it easier to attack.
        * **Example:** "My opponent wants to completely ban all cars!" (When the opponent only proposed stricter emissions standards).
    * **Red Herring:** Introducing an irrelevant issue to distract from the main argument.
        * **Example:** "You're worried about pollution? What about the economy?"
    * **Appeal to Authority:** Citing an unqualified or irrelevant authority to support a claim.
        * **Example:** "My dentist said that climate change is a hoax."
    * **Appeal to Emotion:** Manipulating emotions instead of using logic to persuade.
        * **Example:** "Think of the children!" (Used to shut down debate).
    * **Bandwagon Fallacy:** Arguing that something is true because many people believe it.
        * **Example:** "Everyone knows that aliens have visited Earth."
* **Fallacies of Weak Induction:**
    * **Hasty Generalization:** Drawing a conclusion from insufficient evidence.
        * **Example:** "I met two rude people from that town, so everyone there must be rude."
    * **Weak Analogy:** Comparing two things that are not sufficiently similar.
        * **Example:** "Since my old car needed an oil change every 3,000 miles, my new car will too."
    * **Appeal to Ignorance:** Arguing that something is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa.
        * **Example:** "Since no one has proven ghosts exist, they must not be real."
    * **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc:** Assuming that because one event followed another, the first event caused the second.
        * **Example:** "After I started wearing this lucky hat, my team won every game. Therefore, the hat is causing us to win."
* **Fallacies of Ambiguity:**
    * **Equivocation:** Using a word or phrase with two different meanings in an argument.
        * **Example:** "All banks are by the river. Therefore, I can deposit my money in a river bank."
    * **Amphiboly:** Ambiguity due to sentence structure.
        * **Example:** "I saw the man with the telescope." (Who had the telescope?)
* **Fallacies of Presumption:**
    * **Begging the Question:** Assuming the conclusion in the premises.
        * **Example:** "The Bible is true because it says so in the Bible."
    * **False Dilemma (False Dichotomy):** Presenting only two options when more exist.
        * **Example:** "You're either with us or against us."
    * **Slippery Slope:** Arguing that one event will inevitably lead to a chain of negative consequences.
        * **Example:** "If we allow same-sex marriage, then people will start marrying animals!"

**Key Considerations:**

* **Context:** The context of the argument is important in determining whether a flaw is present.
* **Degree:** Some flaws are more serious than others.
* **Purpose:** Identifying flaws is crucial for evaluating arguments and making informed decisions.

By understanding these common types of flaws, you can become a more critical thinker and a more persuasive arguer. You'll be able to spot weaknesses in arguments and construct your own arguments more effectively.

# lsat articles Identify the conclusion

You're asking about a common and crucial question type on the LSAT: "Identify the Conclusion."  This question tests your ability to understand the *main point* the author is trying to prove.  It's vital to distinguish the conclusion from the evidence used to support it (the premises).

Here's a breakdown of how to approach these questions:

**1. Understand the Task:**

The question will usually ask something like:

* "Which of the following best expresses the main conclusion of the argument?"
* "The author's main point is that..."
* "Which of the following is the conclusion drawn by the author?"

Your job is to find the *one* statement that represents the author's overall point.

**2. Read Actively and Carefully:**

Don't skim!  Pay close attention to the relationships between the different sentences.  Ask yourself: "What is the author trying to convince me of?"

**3. Look for Conclusion Indicators:**

These words often signal that a conclusion is about to be stated:

* Therefore
* Thus
* Hence
* Consequently
* As a result
* It follows that
* Clearly
* Obviously
* In conclusion
* So

However, be careful!  These words aren't *always* used to introduce conclusions.  Sometimes they connect premises or introduce intermediate conclusions.

**4. Identify the Premises:**

What reasons or evidence does the author provide to support their point?  Understanding the premises will help you identify what the author is trying to prove *based on* those premises.

**5. Paraphrase the Main Point:**

Put the author's conclusion into your own words.  This can help you clarify the main point and avoid getting tricked by answer choices that are close but not quite right.

**6. Evaluate the Answer Choices:**

* **Match the Scope:** The correct answer choice will match the scope of the author's conclusion.  Don't choose an answer that is too broad or too narrow.
* **Avoid Restatements of Premises:**  A common trap is to offer a premise as the conclusion.  Remember, the conclusion is what the author is *trying to prove*, not the evidence they are using.
* **Beware of Intermediate Conclusions:**  Sometimes an argument will have sub-conclusions that support the main conclusion.  These are not the main conclusion itself.
* **Look for the "Why":** Ask yourself, "Why does the author believe this?"  The answer to that question will often lead you to the premises, and understanding the premises will help you identify the conclusion.

**7. Practice, Practice, Practice:**

The best way to get better at identifying conclusions is to practice with lots of LSAT arguments.  Pay attention to the structure of the arguments and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.

**Example (Simplified):**

"All cats are mammals. Fluffy is a cat. Therefore, Fluffy is a mammal."

* **Premises:** All cats are mammals. Fluffy is a cat.
* **Conclusion:** Fluffy is a mammal.

**Key Trap:**  The LSAT will often present answer choices that are tempting but not quite the *main* conclusion.  They might be related, but not the central point the author is arguing.
