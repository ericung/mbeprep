#### **Phase 4: Consumer Testing and Feedback Integration**  
**Task**: Evaluate the taste preferences and nutritional needs of soldiers to ensure the cheese component enhances MRE satisfaction.  
- **Responsibilities**:  
   - Organize field tests with military personnel to gather feedback on the taste, texture, and usability of the cheese options in MREs.  
   - Adjust production methods and packaging based on consumer feedback to improve quality and functionality.  
   - Document findings and develop long-term strategies for refining future MRE cheese components.  

---

#### **Phase 5: Market Strategy and Expansion**  
**Task**: Explore opportunities to expand the use of the MRE cheese component beyond military applications, targeting civilian markets such as outdoor adventurers or emergency preparedness kits.  
- **Responsibilities**:  
   - Collaborate with OSF-19 units to develop pricing models that ensure cost-effectiveness while maximizing profitability.  
   - Launch a marketing campaign highlighting the sustainable production process and superior taste of the cheese component.  
   - Secure partnerships with outdoor gear retailers, emergency supply companies, or food distributors to expand market reach.

### **Potential Challenges and Solutions**
- **Challenge**: Fluctuating cheese supply due to changing market conditions.  
   - **Solution**: Dynamic supply chain modeling with alternative procurement plans (e.g., blending cheeses or sourcing from multiple regions).  
- **Challenge**: Maintaining flavor and texture after processing.  
   - **Solution**: Collaborate with food scientists to refine freeze-drying and rehydration methods for cheese preservation.  
- **Challenge**: Balancing sustainability with cost-effectiveness.  
   - **Solution**: Scale production and partner with local suppliers to minimize transportation costs and environmental impact.
