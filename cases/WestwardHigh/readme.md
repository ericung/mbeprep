### Westward High School

It’s the modern era and by modern, I mean it’s 2025 and I’m sitting in the classroom looking at the window bored of listening to Mrs. Rodriguez’s stupid lecture on the history of modern philosophy on why critically thinking about the geo-political mumbo-jumbo can save the planet from collapsing from itself due to conflicting human interests on the lack of physical resources. I kind of doze halfway through her daily rambling like usual as some of the other kids take notes and the others do whatever they do to look busy. I’m at the back of the class like the star of the show watching some of the kids in the background chatting a little bit but most of them look like they’re jotting down notes quietly or they’re probably texting each other like usual. The minute I pressed on my smartphone, Andrew, Ben, and Samantha burst out laughing. 

“Mark!!! You get your cheeky little hands off that device and sit right here in front of class. Oh my god! I have to watch you every single second!!!”, Mrs. Rodriguez snapped almost losing her hair this time.

“ChatGPT autocorrected me!!! I swear!”, I snorted out trying my best not to crackle.

The entire class is bursting in laughter with someone somewhere in the middle of room saying, “Yeah right Mark! We all know you wrote it!”

The end result of all this is me taking my Chromebook, the cheapest but most effective laptop in the world, to the front of the room next to Mrs. Rodriguez’s desk in a walk of shame but the biggest selling point is that I’m used to it now so I do it with my head held up high, proud of myself this time. I grab my backpack and make my way there and as I do, I conveniently trip over Lacey’s belongings as intended of the professional clown I am. 

“Hey Mark!”, as she is left off guard not knowing how to react but obviously should know by now. 

“Thanks for letting me know you shop at the local girl’s club, Lacey!”, I replied.

“Oh my god! Don’t tell anyone that!”, she replied as her face turned red.

I walk to the front regardless of the situation and plop down on the seat. I’m really good at computers so there’s a wave of laughter every 30 seconds because I found a neat little trick to fill everyone’s Chromebook with easy, self-answering questions to today’s quiz. 

“Wow! Today’s test was really easy Mrs. Rodriguez!”, exclaimed Peter with little to no attention to the rest of the class or hiding it really well.

Mrs. Rodriguez looks at me angrily, almost like she’s about ready to kill me at any second but before she does, I blurted out, “There’s no proof!” and she points me to the principal’s office. What should have been a four-hour long test, turned out to be a half hour of hilarity because someone, definitely not me by any chance, cut it down and ruined the national test scores. I don’t think I was paying attention to class today as usual as the principal is fuming at me right now saying something but who knows, I’m just thinking about how I should spend time after detention today.
