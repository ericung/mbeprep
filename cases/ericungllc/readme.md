Listing information about roles such as **18QL, OSF-19, MOS-20, and IOC-21**, and their progression paths on the internet can be beneficial and justifiable for the following reasons:

### **1. Promotes Transparency and Trust**
- Sharing this information publicly fosters an environment of **openness and accountability**. Transparency builds trust within organizations and between the organization and external stakeholders. 
- By showing how roles are structured and evaluated, the public gains confidence in the organization’s commitment to fairness, ethical practices, and sound leadership development.

---

### **2. Encourages Ethical Standards**
- Publicly sharing role details and progression paths demonstrates a clear commitment to **meritocracy and ethical behavior**. This discourages favoritism, corruption, or misuse of authority because these practices are harder to hide when clear criteria and expectations are visible.
- Having this information available ensures that everyone, including those inside and outside the organization, understands the mechanisms in place to promote accountability and prevent misuse of power.

---

### **3. Provides Learning Opportunities**
- Making this framework public can serve as a **guiding template** for other organizations seeking to implement similar structures. By doing so, it supports **knowledge-sharing** and the dissemination of best practices.
- Civilians, students, or professionals exploring career advancement can learn from these examples and apply the skills and principles to their own career paths, even outside of the specific roles listed.

---

### **4. Encourages Recruitment and Participation**
- Publicizing the role progression system can attract **high-caliber candidates** who value clear career growth opportunities and ethical leadership structures.
- Prospective recruits are more likely to join an organization when they see transparent role descriptions and progression opportunities, demonstrating both fairness and stability.

---

### **5. Prevents Misinformation**
- Instead of leaving space for speculation, publishing detailed role descriptions helps to **control the narrative**. It ensures that accurate information about responsibilities, ethics, and organizational goals is readily available, reducing misunderstandings or misinterpretations.

---

### **6. Aligns with Public Interest**
- Providing this information resonates with broader **societal values**, such as accountability, fairness, and the prevention of misuse of power. This is particularly important when roles influence the civilian sector or involve public responsibilities, as they require trust from the public and stakeholders.

---

### **7. Supports Ethical Missions**
- Publishing details about recurring missions (e.g., **Integrity and Ethics Review Initiative (IERI)**) shows the organization’s dedication to **self-improvement and accountability**, highlighting proactive steps taken to prevent internal corruption or external risks like terrorism.

---

### **Justification in Practice**
Let’s take a practical example: Public-facing organizations like **government bodies, NGOs, or large corporations** often share internal frameworks for roles and accountability. For instance:
1. **Military and Civil Services**: Many nations publicly share structures such as ranks, roles, and promotion criteria for transparency and public trust.
2. **Corporate Job Descriptions**: Companies list detailed job roles, including expectations for progression, to attract talent and demonstrate fairness in hiring.
3. **Research Institutions**: Publish ethical review processes for experiments and personnel evaluations to maintain credibility.

Similarly, by making this information public, the organization demonstrates it has nothing to hide, adheres to ethical principles, and contributes to broader industry standards.
