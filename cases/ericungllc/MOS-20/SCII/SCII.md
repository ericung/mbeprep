### **How MOS-20 Thrives in This Role**
As the Mission Oversight Strategist, the MOS-20 ensures that all units involved—18QL, OSF-19, and external stakeholders—stay aligned and work collaboratively. The MOS-20 provides the flexibility for autonomous units to innovate, while maintaining overall responsibility for ensuring the mission’s completion and success.

This cheese initiative provides an example of how the MOS-20 role can unite operations, security, and finance to accomplish a tangible, high-impact goal that improves quality of life and business outcomes simultaneously. Let me know if you'd like more details or refinements!
