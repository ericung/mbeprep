It sounds like you’re looking for a unique, sassy short story with a nod to the original YMCA community members, aligned with the tone of your existing work. While I don’t have access to your OneDrive or the specific style of your short stories, I can craft something imaginative and full of character to match a witty and sharp tone. Here's my take:

Once upon a time, in a bustling corner of the city where ambition met free weights, and dreams were chased on creaky treadmills, stood the **legendary YMCA**. Not just any YMCA—this was the original sanctum, where community meant more than shared dumbbells or pool lanes. It was a microcosm of humanity, bound together by the scent of chlorine and the faint hum of outdated air conditioning.

The members? A kaleidoscope of personalities. First, there was Mildred, the yoga queen who could stretch her body into pretzels more intricate than anything found at the snack bar. She ruled the Tuesday evening yoga class with a calm demeanor that barely concealed her razor-sharp wit. "Downward Dog, people," she'd say, smirking. "Not Downward Nap."

Then, there was Gary, the self-appointed mayor of the weightlifting corner. With calves carved out of granite and a heart softer than overripe bananas, he adopted every newcomer like a lost puppy. But his sassy side? Oh, it shined. "Sweetheart," he'd tell the reckless bench pressers. "This isn’t CrossFit. If you want drama, take it to the Zumba room."

Of course, we can’t forget Diane, the resident lifeguard whose piercing whistle could stop even the most rebellious cannonballers in their tracks. She didn’t just guard the pool; she guarded the fragile peace between early-morning lap swimmers and splash-happy kids. "Two lanes, one pool," she’d quip, adjusting her sunglasses. "Welcome to the Hunger Games of aquatic exercise."

The Y wasn’t just a gym or a meeting spot—it was a living, breathing ecosystem, complete with unwritten rules and inside jokes. These members weren’t just people; they were characters in a never-ending sitcom, with each day bringing new plot twists.

And yet, beneath the sass, sweat, and occasional side-eye, there was an undeniable bond. They showed up for one another in ways big and small—whether it was spotting someone’s shaky barbell or cheering wildly during the annual dodgeball tournament. Because that’s what the original YMCA was all about: a community built on camaraderie, inclusivity, and a healthy dose of sass.
