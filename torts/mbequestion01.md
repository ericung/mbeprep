In tort law, "no privity" refers to situations where a party can be held liable for harm caused to another, even if there is no direct contractual relationship between them. This concept has evolved significantly over time, particularly in product liability cases.

Traditionally, the doctrine of privity limited liability in torts to parties who had a direct contractual relationship. However, this restriction has been relaxed in many jurisdictions to allow for recovery in cases where a duty of care is owed, regardless of a direct contract.

Here are some key aspects of "no privity" in torts:

1. **Product Liability:** Manufacturers can be held liable for injuries caused by their defective products, even if the injured person did not purchase the product directly from them. This is a significant exception to the traditional privity requirement.

2. **Negligence:** A duty of care may exist even without a direct contractual relationship. For example, a driver owes a duty of care to all other road users, regardless of whether they have a contract with them.

3. **Third-Party Beneficiaries:** In some cases, a person who is not a party to a contract may still be able to sue for damages if they were an intended beneficiary of the contract.

4. **Exceptions:** There are exceptions to the "no privity" rule. For example, in some jurisdictions, professionals like lawyers and accountants may only be held liable for negligence to those with whom they have a direct contractual relationship.

It's important to note that the specific rules and exceptions regarding privity in torts can vary by jurisdiction. If you have a specific legal question or issue related to privity, it's best to consult with a qualified attorney in your jurisdiction.
